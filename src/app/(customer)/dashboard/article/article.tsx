                  A Brief History of Coffee Shops
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  The history of coffee shops dates back to the 15th century in the Middle East, where coffee was first cultivated. The first coffee house, known as a qahveh khaneh, opened in Constantinople (now Istanbul) in the 16th century. These establishments quickly became popular social hubs, where people gathered to discuss politics, literature, and culture over a cup of coffee.
